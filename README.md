# mataho

A rust command line tool that allows you to interact with your local Tahoma box.
This is a port of the cli from my [somfy-home-controller](https://github.com/coko7/somfy-home-controller) project.

New features have been added:
- Fuzzy matching for device labels
- Group management
- Executing an action on a group of devices

## üõ†Ô∏è Setup

Create a config file at `$HOME/.config/mataho/config.json`:
```json
{
    "hostname": "https://gateway-XXXX-XXXX-XXXX"
    "port": 8443,
    "api_token": "PUT_YOUR_SUPER_SECRET_TOKEN_HERE",
}
```

*NOTE: If you want to use a different path for the configuration direction, you can do so by setting the `$MATAHO_CONFIG` env variable.*

*You must keep the filename as `config.json` though.*

## üêö Usage

Typing `mataho help` will print the documentation:
```
$ mataho help

Interact with your Tahoma box in the terminal

Usage: mataho [OPTIONS] <COMMAND>

Commands:
  list   Print the list of known local devices [aliases: ls]

  exec   Execute a Tahoma action on a single device [aliases: ex]
  group  Create and manage groups of devices [aliases: grp]
  help   Print this message or the help of the given subcommand(s)
